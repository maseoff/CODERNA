# Existing Problems and ToDo

1. Add the following rules when use function `pyformat(code: str) -> str`:

    1.1. Control the renaming of variables. Don't forget about such constructions:
    `from ... import ... as ...`

    1.2. Control the unsused variables and imports

2. Make sure that the code will be able to compile after using
`pyformat(code: str) -> str`. There's no guarantee now.
